# emolt_realtime
This is an old collection of python code used to acquire, process, visualize, telemeter, quality control, and serve realtime eMOLT data.
There is another repository with the non-realtime eMOLT code.

As of Dec 2021, the most up-to-date realtime code is stored in the "Huanxin" branch since he was afraid to overwrite JiMs earlier versions in the "Master" branch.

In 2022, we started posting our most up-to-date code on George Maynard's repository https://github.com/GMaynard1/emolt_serverside and https://github.com/GMaynard1/emolt_deckbox

The main acquisition code (on board the vessels) is called "rock_getmatp.py".  Many of the other routines are associated with post-processing both the telemtered and the raw wified data.
