# emolt_realtime
This is a collection of python code used to acquire, process, visualize, telemeter, quality control, and serve realtime eMOLT data.
There is another repository with the non-realtime eMOLT code.

As of Dec 2021, the most up-to-date realtime code is stored in the "Huanxin" branch since he was afraid to overwrite JiMs earlier versions in the "Master" branch.

The main acquisition code (on board the vessels) is called "rock_getmatp.py".  Many of the other routines are associated with post-processing both the telemtered and the raw wified data.
